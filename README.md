  <em>mountains and tree range during golden hour</em>
  
  <em>It was a rainy evening and we were far from a place we wanted to reach. When we were close to a viewing point we saw that sun was shining through a tiny crack in the clouds and the whole valley was filled with a golden light. We ran like the Fellowship of the Ring, jumping over tree roots and steps of a staircase to the viewing point. The whole shoot took around three minutes: unpack a camera, set up a tripod, choose and change a lens, compose a frame, focus and shoot. I had enough time to only take four frames with different exposures and the sun had gone.</em>
