  <em>I had been travelling around Central America, living in a van and sharing experiences with other travelers.  Having just dropped my last travel buddy off I headed back to Lake Atitlan and found an incredible spot to camp right next to the lake.  There was this jetty sticking out into the lake where I sat watching the sunset, once again living the dream on my own. I knew something special was happening there, and now it has become BitcoinLake!</em>
