### 👋 Hi there!

I'm currently a ~Support Engineer~ _something_ for GitHub.

I like making things. Something about automating manual processes satisfies my soul ❤️

Check out my [Human User Guide (HUG)](https://gist.github.com/BagToad/a28f06f1c46e6e5d419b98921e835f40) to learn more about working with me.

Please have a look at my projects! I think they're neat, and I pour my heart and soul into everything.

  <em>"A small isle in the Eibsee at the beginning of November in 2018. Because it was a really nice and warm day some canoeists stayed at the island in the sund to relax.

This is the horizontal version of a photo I already posted last year."</em>
