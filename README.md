### 👋 Hi there!

I'm a Support Engineer for GitHub, but I like making things. Something about automating manual processes satisfies my soul ❤️

Please have a look at my projects! I think they're neat, and I pour my heart and soul into everything.

- 🔗 [Zendesk Link Collector](https://github.com/BagToad/Zendesk-Link-Collector) 
  - A powerful browser extension to aggregate Zendesk ticket data based on RegEx patterns.
- 🌊 [Random Unsplash Action](https://github.com/BagToad/random-unsplash-action)
  - A lovely GitHub Action to post images to your GitHub readme (see below 🏞️)
- 🏃 [ARC Log Collection Scripts](https://github.com/BagToad/arc-log-collection-scripts)
  - A collection of Shell scripts to dump diagnostic information and logs from an [Actions Runner Controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller) deployment.
- 🧘 Other Zendesk tweaks to make life easier 😊
  - [Add Zendesk Comment Borders](https://github.com/BagToad/add-zendesk-comment-borders)
  - [Auto-Hide Zendesk Composer](https://github.com/BagToad/Auto-Hide-Zendesk-Composer)
- 🐸 [AI Generated BagToads](https://github.com/BagToad/bagtoads)
  - Some BagToad images generated by AI 🐸

Did you notice a theme!? I work with GitHub Actions and Zendesk a lot! 😅

- 🔗 Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kynan-ware/)
- 🤝 Collaborate with me on literally anything
  - 🪴 I want to learn and share experiences about topics such as JavaScript, shell scripts, Support/Customer Service, Kubernetes, and more.
  - 💡 I want to know about new projects that might align with my skills
  - 📚 I want to read interesting and well written blog posts
  - 🪨 I want to know about others' personal knowledge management systems, particularly [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
