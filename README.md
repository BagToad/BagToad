### 👋 Hi there!

I'm currently a ~Support Engineer~ _something_ for GitHub.

I like making things. Something about automating manual processes satisfies my soul ❤️

Check out my [Human User Guide (HUG)](https://gist.github.com/BagToad/a28f06f1c46e6e5d419b98921e835f40) to learn more about working with me.

Please have a look at my projects! I think they're neat, and I pour my heart and soul into everything.

  <em>"I remember seeing a picture like this a long time ago. I knew at that point that I would have to go and experience it for myself one day. After some research, it turns out that if you wait until the end of the Summer the sun sets right at the top of the valley resulting in this magnificent sunset! 

I still feel like the picture doesn’t even do it justice!"</em>
